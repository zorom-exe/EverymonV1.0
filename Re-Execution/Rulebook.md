# Everymon Official Rulebook

**Version:** 1.0
**Philosophy:** Everymon is a sandbox for creativity, but a battleground for skill. To ensure fair competition in the Global Arcade, all players must adhere to these rules.

---

## 1. Battle Format (The Standard)
All "Ranked" or "Standard" matches in the Lobby follow the **6v6 Singles** format.
*   **Level:** All Pokémon are auto-leveled to **50**.
*   **Team Size:** 6 Pokémon.
*   **Time Limit:** 60 seconds per turn. 10 minutes total per player.

### 1.1. Combat Clauses
These clauses are enforced by the Battle Engine to prevent uncompetitive strategies.
*   **Sleep Clause:** You can only put one enemy Pokémon to sleep at a time.
*   **Evasion Clause:** Moves that boost Evasion (e.g., Double Team, Minimize) are banned.
*   **OHKO Clause:** One-Hit KO moves (Fissure, Guillotine, Horn Drill, Sheer Cold) are banned.
*   **Species Clause:** A player cannot have two Pokémon of the exact same Species ID on their team.
*   **Endless Battle Clause:** If a battle setup forces an infinite loop (e.g., Leppa Berry recycling), the game will force a draw or loss for the stalling player.

## 2. Custom Creation Limits
To prevent "God Mode" creations, all Custom Pokémon must pass the **Validation Sandbox**.

### 2.1. Base Stat Total (BST) Caps
*   **Standard Limit:** Max **600 BST** (Pseudo-Legendary tier).
*   **"Min-Max" Tax:**
    *   No single stat can exceed **200**.
    *   No single stat can be lower than **10**.
    *   *Why?* To prevent "cheesy" builds like 255 Speed / 1 Defense.

### 2.2. Ability Restrictions
Certain abilities are overpowered when combined with high stats.
*   **Wonder Guard:** **BANNED.** (Too polarizing for custom meta).
*   **Huge Power / Pure Power:** Banned on any Pokémon with Base Attack > **60**.
*   **Speed Boost:** Banned on any Pokémon with Base Speed > **100**.
*   **Shadow Tag / Arena Trap:** **BANNED.** (Trapping abilities remove player agency).

### 2.3. Movepool Logic
*   **Signature Limit:** A Custom Pokémon may have **MAX 1** Custom Move. All other moves must be from the official Gen 9 Dex.
*   **Logic Check:**
    *   A Fire type cannot learn distinct Water moves (e.g., Hydro Pump) unless it is dual-type Water.
    *   *Suggestion:* Implement a "Type Affinity" system where you get 100 "Move Points" to buy moves. Off-type moves cost double.

## 3. Fair Play & Conduct
The Global Lobby is a shared space.

### 3.1. User Conduct
*   **Names:** No offensive, hateful, or explicit names for Trainers or Pokémon.
*   **Lobby Stalling:** Do not create a Lobby ("Hosting...") and refuse to start the game when a challenger joins.
*   **Ghosting:** Spectating a match to tell a friend the opponent's moves is considered cheating. *Note: The system tries to prevent this by hiding unrevealed info, but honor is required.*

### 3.2. Connection Integrity
*   **The "Rage Quit" Rule:** If you disconnect or close the tab, you have **60 seconds** to reconnect. After that, you automatically Forfeit.
*   **Intentional Lag:** Artificial lag switching will result in a Desync Error and potential account ban.

## 4. Suggested "House Rules" (for Future Modes)
*These are experimental rules for specific lobbies.*

*   **"Little Cup" Mode:** Max BST **350**. Level 5. Custom "Baby" Pokémon only.
*   **"Monotype" Wars:** All 6 Pokémon must share a common Type.
*   **"Draft League":** Players take turns picking Abilities from a shared pool before the match. (e.g., Only one player gets 'Intimidate').
